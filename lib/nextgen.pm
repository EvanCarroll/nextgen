=head1 NAME

nextgen - enable all of the features of next-generation perl 5 with one command

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The B<nextgen> pragma uses several modules to enable additional features of Perl
and of the CPAN.  Instead of copying and pasting all of these C<use> lines,
instead write only one:

    use nextgen;

For now, this module

=over 12

=item Perl assertion

asserts 5.10.1+ is loaded -- 5.10.0 is unsupported and not forwards
  compatable because of smart match.

=item strict and warnings

uses the vanilla L<strict>, and L<warnings> pragmas

=item features.pm

adds Perl 5.10 L<features>

=item indirect.pm

disables indirect method syntax via L<indirect>

=item autodie.pm

throws fatal exceptions in a sane fashion for CORE functions via L<autodie>

=item mro.pm

C3 method resolution order via L<mro>

=item Moose.pm

adds L<Moose> if the package isn't main

=item oose.pm

uses L<oose>.pm if the program is run via C<perl -e>, or C<perl -E>

=item namespace/autoclean.pm

cleans up the class via L<namespace::autoclean> if the module has a constructor (sub new).

In the future, L<nextgen> will include additional CPAN modules which have proven useful and stable.

=back

This module started out as a fork of L<Modern::Perl>, it wasn't modern enough
and the author wasn't attentive enough to the needs for a more modern perl5.

=head1 PROCEDURAL CODE

If you wish to write L<nextgen> module that doesn't assume non-"main" packages
are object-oriented classes, then use the B<:procedural> token:

    use nextgen mode => qw(:procedural)
